# Apply Brand specific styles to a CIF Project

The [CIF Project archetype](https://github.com/adobe/aem-cif-project-archetype) creates a minimal Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) CIF project as a starting point for customer projects using [CIF Core Components](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-cif-components). A default style, known as the Venia brand, is initially applied to the site. 

In this tutorial we will inspect a new AEM CIF project, generated by the archetype, and apply new

## Prerequisites

The following tools and technologies are required:

* [Java 1.8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html) (AEM 6.5+ only)
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (3.3.9 or newer)
* Adobe Experience Manager (local instance)
  * [AEM 6.5](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-65/deploying/introduction/technical-requirements.html)
  * [AEM 6.4.4+](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-64/release-notes/sp-release-notes.html)
* Magento running a [version compatible to the archetype](https://github.com/adobe/aem-cif-project-archetype#requirements)

It is recommended to review the following content:

* [Creating a new AEM CIF Project - Tutorial](../getting-started/02-new-cif-project.md)

## Generate a project

We will generate a new AEM CIF project using the [CIF Project archetype](https://github.com/adobe/aem-cif-project-archetype) and then override the default styles. Feel free to use an existing project based on the CIF Project Archetype.

1. Determine the latest version of the CIF Project Archetype by viewing [the latest release on GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/aem-cif-project-archetype/releases/latest). In the next step replace `x.y.z` with the version of the latest release.

2. Run the following Maven command to generate a new project in [batch mode](https://maven.apache.org/archetype/maven-archetype-plugin/examples/generate-batch.html).

    ```terminal
    mvn archetype:generate -B \
        -DarchetypeGroupId="com.adobe.commerce.cif" \
        -DarchetypeArtifactId="cif-project-archetype" \
        -DarchetypeVersion=x.y.z \
        -DgroupId="com.acme.cif" \
        -DartifactId="acme-store" \
        -Dversion=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT \
        -Dpackage="com.acme.cif" \
        -DappsFolderName="acme" \
        -DartifactName="Acme Store" \
        -DcontentFolderName="acme" \
        -DpackageGroup="acme" \
        -DsiteName="Acme Store" \
        -DoptionAemVersion=6.5.0 \
        -DoptionIncludeExamples=y \
        -DoptionEmbedConnector=y
    ```

3. Build and deploy the project to a local instance of AEM:

    ```shell
    $ cd acme-store/
    $ mvn clean install -PautoInstallAll
    ```

4. Add the necessary OSGi configurations to connect your AEM instance to a Magento instance by following the [AEM and Magento Integration - Video](../getting-started/01-getting-started.md) or add the configurations to the newly created project by following the instructions in [Creating a new AEM CIF Project - Tutorial](../getting-started/02-new-cif-project.md).

5. At this point you should have a working version of a storefront that is connected to a Magento instance. Navigate to the `US` > `Home` page at: [http://localhost:4502/editor.html/content/acme/us/en.html](http://localhost:4502/editor.html/content/acme/us/en.html)

    You should see that the storefront currently is using the Venia theme. Expanding the Main Menu of the storefront, you should see various categories, indicating that the connection Magento is working.

## Client-side Library Inclusion

The CSS and JavaScript responsible for rendering the theme/styles of the storefront is managed in AEM in something call a [Client-side library](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-65/developing/introduction/clientlibs.html) or clientlibs for short. Client-side provide a mechanism to organize CSS and Javascript in a project's code and then deliver onto the page.

There are several options for how to include a client-side library in an implementation. Next we will inspect how the generated project includes the theme client-side libraries via [Page Templates](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-65/developing/platform/templates/page-templates-editable.html).

1. From the AEM Start screen navigate to **Tools** > **General** > **Templates**.

2. Navigate into the **Acme Store Configuration** and open the **Catalog Page Template** by selecting the *pencil* icon.
